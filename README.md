# TeamFortress2-Dedicated-Server

Are you gatvol of having to play with >180ms latency simply because there are no populated game servers nearby?

This project aims to foster and inspire the growth of indepentant gaming communities in regions which are otherwise inhibit by running costs or latency. This platform serves as a framework for the average person to host their own dedicated, game server in a region close enough to their physical geographical location to mitigate the latency effects of connecting to game servers in distance locations.
